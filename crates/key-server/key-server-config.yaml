#### Mandatory configurations ####

# Network to use. Should be one of:
# network: Testnet
# network: Mainnet
# network: Devnet
# network: !Custom
#   node_url: 'url_to_node_endpoint'
#
# Use Custom for production deployments, and set the `node_url` 
# with the URL of your Full Node endpoint.
#
# Example:
network: Testnet


# Server mode. The server can either work in Open/permissionless mode that 
# supports all packages, or in Permissioned mode that only supports
# whitelisted packages .
#
# For the Open mode, set the registered key server object ID to be used, e.g.,:
# server_mode: !Open
#   key_server_object_id: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'
#
# Example:
server_mode: !Open
  key_server_object_id: '0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000'

#
# For the Permissioned mode, set the allowed clients and their configurations.
# A client config contains:
# - Client name - for debugging purposes only, can always be modified.
# - The associated key server object id. Should never change.
# - The allowed packages with Seal policies. Must be unique and point to the
#   first versions of the packages. Packages can be added to the list later.
# - The type of the client master key. See below.
#
# In normal setting, use Derived key type for deriving the client master key
# from the server master key. Set derivation_index to be a unique derivation
# index used for this client. This value must *never* change, else a different
# key might be used for that client.
#
# If a client master key is exported, change the type to Exported and track
# the derivation index in deprecated_derivation_index (to make sure it is
# not used in the future).
#
# In case the client master key is imported, use Imported and set the env_var
# to an environment variable that contains the BLS key in hex format.
#
# Example of a permissioned server mode configuration:
# server_mode: !Permissioned
#   client_configs:
#     - name: "alice"
#       client_master_key: !Derived
#         derivation_index: 1
#       key_server_object_id: "0xaaaa000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001"
#       package_ids:
#         - "0x1111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111"
#     - name: "bob"
#       client_master_key: !Imported
#         env_var: "BOB_BLS_KEY"
#       key_server_object_id: "0xbbbb000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002"
#       package_ids:

#         - "0x2222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222222223"
#     - name: "carol"
#       client_master_key: !Exported
#         deprecated_derivation_index: 3
#       key_server_object_id: "0xcccc000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000003"
#       package_ids:
#         - "0x3333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333333"
