# Seal pricing

- **Choose your own key server providers:** Seal supports a decentralized network of independent key servers. Builders can select any combination of providers to form their preferred threshold configuration for encryption and decryption.
- **Transparent pricing & features:** Each key server provider sets their own pricing and rate limits based on their service model. Builders can evaluate and choose based on what best fits their application needs.
- **Curated discoverability:** This documentation will list a verified set of providers along with available links to their configuration details, terms, and pricing, so you can integrate with confidence.

## Verified key servers

Please refer to [this document](UsingSeal.md#for-key-server-operators) for detailed information on `Open` and `Permissioned` modes of key servers. At a high-level:

- A key server in `Open` mode lets anyone request keys for any access policy package, using a shared master key. It is ideal for public or trial use. 
- A key server in `Permissioned` mode restricts access to approved access policy packages per client, each with a dedicated master key, and supports secure key server rotation or switching when needed. It is designed for dedicated or commercial use.

### Testnet

- Mysten Labs: The following key servers are configured using the `Open` mode and freely available for experimentation, development, and testing. A source-based rate limit is configured which can not be changed for any client.

> [!NOTE]
> Testnet key servers are provided for developer testing only and do not come with availability guarantees, SLAs, or assurances regarding long-term key persistence. Please avoid using them to encrypt data you expect to access reliably in the future.

> [!NOTE]
> The `URL` for any listed key server may change over time. What matters is the `Object Id`, which points to the onchain key server object. That object always holds the latest `URL` as the source of truth.
